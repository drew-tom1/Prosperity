## Tourmaline

Tourmaline is a stock analysis tool I created. It takes in the historical data of a company and outputs a set of predictions for the stock value over the upcoming few days. I built the endpoints using FastAPI and TensorFlow and visualized it onto a Next.js application.

I separated the backend and frontend for easier scaling and deployment. I deployed the frontend on Vercel and the backend on GCP.
